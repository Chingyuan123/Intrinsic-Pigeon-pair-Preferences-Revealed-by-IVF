# Intrinsic-Pigeon-pair-Preferences-Revealed-by-IVF

This space is mainly used to provide program files and data files used in the paper "Intrinsic Pigeon-pair Preferences Revealed by IVF". 
The repository consists of three parts: 1. Code files 2. Data files for estimation 3. Data files for figures and tables. 
Code files are divided into four parts: 
Part 1: Compilation of raw data (in STATA). 
Part 2: Estimation of the proportion of delivering mothers who adopt IVF in the mother group indexed by age (a) and family wealth-rank (w) in period (t) using Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) regression (in STATA).
Part 3: Estimation of the gender preference parameters of first-birth mothers who adopt IVFs (using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, MLE, in R).
Part 4: Calculation of the MLE standard errors of parameters and the values used in Figures 3(a) and (b) based on the estimates obtained in Part 3 (in STATA). 
There are two data files for estimation, with the ivf_01.dta corresponding to part 2 of the code files and the ivf_02.dta corresponding to part 3. 
The Data files for figures and tables include the values of figure 1 to 4, as well as table 1 and 2.
