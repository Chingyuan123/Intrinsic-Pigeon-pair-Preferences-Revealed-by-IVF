This space is mainly used to provide code files and data files used in the paper "Intrinsic Pigeon-pair Preferences Revealed by IVF". 
The repository consists of three parts: 1. Code files 2. Data files for estimation 3. Data files for figures and tables. 
Code files are divided into part 1 to 4. 
Part 1 explains how the data is merged and compiled. 
Part 2 is the estimation of equation (1) in the paper. 
Part 3 is the estimation and tests of equation (4). 
Part 4 is the calculation of numerical values for figures and tables. 
There are two data files for estimation, with the ivf_01.dta corresponding to part 2 of the code files and the ivf_02.dta corresponding to part 3. 
The Data files for figures and tables include the values of figure 1 to 4, as well as table 1 and 2.
